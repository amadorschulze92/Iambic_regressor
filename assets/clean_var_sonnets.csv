0, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Some flowers are withered and some joys have died; 
1, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,The garden reeks with an East Indian scent 
2, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,From beds where gillyflowers stand weak and spent; 
3, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,The white heat pales the skies from side to side; 
4, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"But in still lakes and rivers, cool, content, "
5, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Like starry blooms on a new firmament, "
6, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,White lilies float and regally abide. 
7, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,In vain the cruel skies their hot rays shed; 
8, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,The lily does not feel their brazen glare. 
9, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,In vain the pallid clouds refuse to share 
10, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Their dews, the lily feels no thirst, no dread. "
11, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Unharmed she lifts her queenly face and head; 
12, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,She drinks of living waters and keeps fair. 
13, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,O Month when they who love must love and wed! 
14, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Were one to go to worlds where May is naught, "
15, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,And seek to tell the memories he had brought 
16, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"From earth of thee, what were most fitly said? "
17, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,I know not if the rosy showers shed 
18, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"From apple-boughs, or if the soft green wrought "
19, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"In fields, or if the robin's call be fraught "
20, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,The most with thy delight. Perhaps they read 
21, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Thee best who in the ancient time did say 
22, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Thou wert the sacred month unto the old: 
23, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,No blossom blooms upon thy brightest day 
24, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,So subtly sweet as memories which unfold 
25, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"In aged hearts which in thy sunshine lie, "
26, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,To sun themselves once more before they die. 
27, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"O Winter! frozen pulse and heart of fire, "
28, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,What loss is theirs who from thy kingdom turn 
29, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Dismayed, and think thy snow a sculptured urn "
30, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Of death! Far sooner in midsummer tire 
31, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,The streams than under ice. June could not hire 
32, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Her roses to forego the strength they learn 
33, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,In sleeping on thy breast. No fires can burn 
34, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,The bridges thou dost lay where men desire 
35, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,In vain to build. 
36, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"O Heart, when Love's sun goes "
37, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"To northward, and the sounds of singing cease, "
38, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Keep warm by inner fires, and rest in peace. "
39, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Sleep on content, as sleeps the patient rose. "
40, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Walk boldly on the white untrodden snows, "
41, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,The winter is the winter's own release. 
42, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,This is the treacherous month when autumn days 
43, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,With summer's voice come bearing summer's gifts. 
44, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Beguiled, the pale down-trodden aster lifts "
45, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Her head and blooms again. The soft, warm haze "
46, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Makes moist once more the sere and dusty ways, "
47, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"And, creeping through where dead leaves lie in drifts, "
48, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,The violet returns. Snow noiseless sifts 
49, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Ere night, an icy shroud, which morning's rays "
50, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Willidly shine upon and slowly melt, "
51, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Too late to bid the violet live again. 
52, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"The treachery, at last, too late, is plain; "
53, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Bare are the places where the sweet flowers dwelt. 
54, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,What joy sufficient hath November felt? 
55, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,What profit from the violet's day of pain? 
56, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Hand trembling towards hand; the amazing lights 
57, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Of heart and eye. They stood on supreme heights. 
58, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,
59, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Ah, the delirious weeks of honeymoon! "
60, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Soon they returned, and, after strange adventures, "
61, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Settled at Balham by the end of June. 
62, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Their money was in Can. Pacs. B. Debentures, "
63, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,And in Antofagastas. Still he went 
64, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Cityward daily; still she did abide 
65, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,At home. And both were really quite content 
66, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,With work and social pleasures. Then they died. 
67, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"They left three children (besides George, who drank): "
68, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"The eldest Jane, who married Mr Bell, "
69, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"William, the head-clerk in the County Bank, "
70, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"And Henry, a stock-broker, doing well."
71, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,I said I splendidly loved you; it's not true.
72, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Such long swift tides stir not a land-locked sea.
73, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,On gods or fools the high risk falls -- on you --
74, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,The clean clear bitter-sweet that's not for me.
75, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist.
76, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Love is flung Lucifer-like from Heaven to Hell.
77, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"But -- there are wanderers in the middle mist,"
78, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Who cry for shadows, clutch, and cannot tell"
79, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Whether they love at all, or, loving, whom:"
80, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"An old song's lady, a fool in fancy dress,"
81, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Or phantoms, or their own face on the gloom;"
82, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"For love of Love, or from heart's loneliness."
83, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Pleasure's not theirs, nor pain. They doubt, and sigh,"
84, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,And do not love at all. Of these am I.
85, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Not with vain tears, when we’re beyond the sun, "
86, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"We’ll beat on the substantial doors, nor tread "
87, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead 
88, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Plaintive for Earth; but rather turn and run 
89, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Down some close-covered by-way of the air,"
90, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Some low sweet alley between wind and wind, "
91, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, find "
92, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook, and there "
93, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,
94, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Spend in pure converse our eternal day; 
95, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Think each in each, immediately wise;"
96, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Learn all we lacked before; hear, know, and say "
97, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,What this tumultuous body now denies; 
98, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"And feel, who have laid our groping hands away; "
99, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"And see, no longer blinded by our eyes."
100, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Oh! Death will find me, long before I tire"
101, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Of watching you; and swing me suddenly
102, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Into the shade and loneliness and mire
103, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Of the last land! There, waiting patiently,"
104, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,
105, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"One day, I think, I'll feel a cool wind blowing,"
106, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"See a slow light across the Stygian tide,"
107, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"And hear the Dead about me stir, unknowing,"
108, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"And tremble. And I shall know that you have died,"
109, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,
110, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"And watch you, a broad-browed and smiling dream,"
111, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Pass, light as ever, through the lightless host,"
112, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Quietly ponder, start, and sway, and gleam --"
113, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,Most individual and bewildering ghost! --
114, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,
115, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"And turn, and toss your brown delightful head"
116, Rupert Brooke    Ruper,"Amusedly, among the ancient Dead."
117, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Indeed this very love which is my boast,"
118, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And which, when rising up from breast to brow,"
119, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Doth crown me with a ruby large enow
120, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"To draw men's eyes and prove the inner cost,—"
121, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,"
122, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I should not love withal, unless that thou"
123, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Hadst set me an example, shown me how,"
124, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,"
125, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And love called love. And thus, I cannot speak"
126, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Of love even, as a good thing of my own:"
127, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,"
128, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And placed it by thee on a golden throne,—"
129, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)"
130, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Is by thee only, whom I love alone."
131, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"When our two souls stand up erect and strong,"
132, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,"
133, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Until the lengthening wings break into fire
134, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"At either curved point,—what bitter wrong"
135, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Can the earth do to us, that we should not long"
136, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Be here contented? Think. In mounting higher,"
137, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,The angels would press on us and aspire
138, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,To drop some golden orb of perfect song
139, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay"
140, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Rather on earth, Beloved,—where the unfit"
141, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Contrarious moods of men recoil away
142, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And isolate pure spirits, and permit"
143, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"A place to stand and love in for a day,"
144, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.
145, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers"
146, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Plucked in the garden, all the summer through"
147, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And winter, and it seemed as if they grew"
148, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers."
149, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"So, in the like name of that love of ours,"
150, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,"
151, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,And which on warm and cold days I withdrew
152, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"From my heart's ground. Indeed, those beds and bowers"
153, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,"
154, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And wait thy weeding; yet here's eglantine,"
155, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Here 's ivy!—take them, as I used to do"
156, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Thy fowers, and keep them where they shall not pine."
157, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Instruct thine eyes to keep their colors true,"
158, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,And tell thy soul their roots are left in mine.
159, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"First time he kissed me, he but only kissed"
160, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;
161, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And ever since, it grew more clean and white,"
162, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Slow to world-greetings, quick with its 'Oh, list,'"
163, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst
164, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,"
165, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Than that first kiss. The second passed in height
166, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,"
167, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed!
168, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown,"
169, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"With sanctifying sweetness, did precede."
170, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,The third upon my lips was folded down
171, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,"
172, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I have been proud and said, 'My love, my own.'"
173, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,The first time that the sun rose on thine oath
174, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"To love me, I looked forward to the moon"
175, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
176, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.
177, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;"
178, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And, looking on myself, I seemed not one"
179, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,For such man's love!—more like an out-of-tune
180, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth"
181, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,"
182, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.
183, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I did not wrong myself so, but I placed"
184, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,A wrong on thee. For perfect strains may float
185, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"'Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,—"
186, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat."
187, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Can it be right to give what I can give?
188, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears
189, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years"
190, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Re-sighing on my lips renunciative
191, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live
192, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"For all thy adjurations? O my fears,"
193, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"That this can scarce be right! We are not peers,"
194, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve,"
195, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"That givers of such gifts as mine are, must"
196, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Be counted with the ungenerous. Out, alas!"
197, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I will not soil thy purple with my dust,"
198, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,"
199, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Nor give thee any love—which were unjust.
200, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass."
201, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Say over again, and yet once over again,"
202, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,That thou dost love me. Though the word repeated
203, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Should seem 'a cuckoo-song,' as thou dost treat it,"
204, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Remember, never to the hill or plain,"
205, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain"
206, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.
207, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Beloved, I, amid the darkness greeted"
208, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt's pain"
209, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Cry, 'Speak once more—thou lovest! 'Who can fear"
210, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,"
211, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?"
212, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Say thou dost love me, love me, love me—toll"
213, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"The silver iterance!—only minding, Dear,"
214, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,To love me also in silence with thy soul.
215, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"The face of all the world is changed, I think,"
216, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul
217, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole"
218, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink
219, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,"
220, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Was caught up into love, and taught the whole"
221, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Of life in a new rhythm. The cup of dole
222, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,"
223, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear."
224, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"The names of country, heaven, are changed away"
225, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;"
226, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday,"
227, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,(The singing angels know) are only dear
228, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Because thy name moves right in what they say.
229, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Is it indeed so? If I lay here dead,"
230, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?
231, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,And would the sun for thee more coldly shine
232, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Because of grave-damps falling round my head?
233, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I marvelled, my Beloved, when I read"
234, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Thy thought so in the letter. I am thine—
235, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,But . . . so much to thee? Can I pour thy wine
236, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"While my hands tremble ? Then my soul, instead"
237, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Of dreams of death, resumes life's lower range."
238, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Then, love me, Love! look on me—breathe on me!"
239, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"As brighter ladies do not count it strange,"
240, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"For love, to give up acres and degree,"
241, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange"
242, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"My near sweet view of Heaven, for earth with thee!"
243, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I see thine image through my tears to-night,"
244, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,And yet to-day I saw thee smiling. How
245, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Refer the cause?—Beloved, is it thou"
246, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Or I, who makes me sad? The acolyte"
247, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
248, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,"
249, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"On the altar-stair. I hear thy voice and vow,"
250, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,"
251, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"As he, in his swooning ears, the choir's Amen."
252, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Beloved, dost thou love? or did I see all"
253, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when"
254, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Too vehement light dilated my ideal,"
255, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"For my soul's eyes? Will that light come again,"
256, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,As now these tears come—falling hot and real?
257, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"O month whose promise and fulfilment blend, "
258, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,And burst in one! it seems the earth can store 
259, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,In all her roomy house no treasure more; 
260, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Of all her wealth no farthing have to spend 
261, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"On fruit, when once this stintless flowering end. "
262, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,And yet no tiniest flower shall fall before 
263, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,It hath made ready at its hidden core 
264, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Its tithe of seed, which we may count and tend "
265, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Till harvest. Joy of blossomed love, for thee "
266, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Seems it no fairer thing can yet have birth? 
267, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,No room is left for deeper ecstacy? 
268, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Watch well if seeds grow strong, to scatter free "
269, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Germs for thy future summers on the earth. 
270, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,A joy which is but joy soon comes to dearth. 
271, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Month which the warring ancients strangely styled 
272, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"The month of war,--as if in their fierce ways "
273, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Were any month of peace!--in thy rough days 
274, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"I find no war in Nature, though the wild "
275, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Winds clash and clang, and broken boughs are piled "
276, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,As feet of writhing trees. The violets raise 
277, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"Their heads without affright, without amaze, "
278, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"And sleep through all the din, as sleeps a child. "
279, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,And he who watches well may well discern 
280, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Sweet expectation in each living thing. 
281, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Like pregnant mother the sweet earth doth yearn; 
282, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,In secret joy makes ready for the spring; 
283, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,"And hidden, sacred, in her breast doth bear "
284, Helen Hunt Jackson    ,Annunciation lilies for the year.
285, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"With the same heart, I said, I'll answer thee"
286, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"As those, when thou shalt call me by my name—"
287, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,"
288, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy?
289, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"When called before, I told how hastily"
290, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game,"
291, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,To run and answer with the smile that came
292, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"At play last moment, and went on with me"
293, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Through my obedience. When I answer now,"
294, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;"
295, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Yet still my heart goes to thee—ponder how—
296, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Not as to a single good, but all my good!"
297, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow"
298, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,That no child's foot could run fast as this blood.
299, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Oh, yes! they love through all this world of ours!"
300, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth."
301, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I have heard love talked in my early youth,"
302, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And since, not so long back but that the flowers"
303, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Then gathered, smell still. Mussulmans and Giaours"
304, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth"
305, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,For any weeping. Polypheme's white tooth
306, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers,"
307, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"The shell is over-smooth,—and not so much"
308, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate"
309, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Or else to oblivion. But thou art not such
310, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"A lover, my Beloved! thou canst wait"
311, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,"
312, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,And think it soon when others cry 'Too late.'
313, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"And yet, because thou overcomest so,"
314, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Because thou art more noble and like a king,"
315, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
316, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow"
317, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Too close against thine heart henceforth to know
318, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"How it shook when alone. Why, conquering"
319, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,May prove as lordly and complete a thing
320, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"In lifting upward, as in crushing low!"
321, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
322, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,"
323, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Even so, Beloved, I at last record,"
324, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Here ends my strife. If thou invite me forth,"
325, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,I rise above abasement at the word.
326, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth.
327, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,XIX
328, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,
329, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise;
330, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I barter curl for curl upon that mart,"
331, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,And from my poet's forehead to my heart
332, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,—"
333, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes"
334, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
335, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart, . . ."
336, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"The bay-crown's shade, Beloved, I surmise,"
337, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!"
338, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,"
339, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,"I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,"
340, Elizabeth Barrett Browning  poetry,And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;

343, John Donne    John Don,Since she whom I loved hath paid her last debt
344, John Donne    John Don,"To Nature, and to hers, and my good is dead,"
345, John Donne    John Don,"And her soul early into heaven ravished,"
346, John Donne    John Don,Wholly on heavenly things my mind is set.
347, John Donne    John Don,here the admiring her my mind did whet
348, John Donne    John Don,"To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;"
349, John Donne    John Don,"But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,"
350, John Donne    John Don,a holy thristy dropsy melts me yet.
351, John Donne    John Don,"But why should I beg more love, whenas thou"
352, John Donne    John Don,"Dost woo my soul, for hers offering all thine:"
353, John Donne    John Don,And dost not only fear lest I allow
354, John Donne    John Don,"My love to saints and angels, things divine,"
355, John Donne    John Don,but in they tender jealousy dost doubt
356, John Donne    John Don,"lest the world, flesh, yea, devil put thee out."
357, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"Thy cheek is pale with thought, but not from woe,"
358, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"And yet so lovely, that if Mirth could flush"
359, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"Its rose of whiteness with the brightest blush,"
360, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,My heart would wish away that ruder glow:
361, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"And dazzle not thy deep-blue eyes---but, oh!"
362, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"While gazing on them sterner eyes will gush,"
363, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"And into mine my mother's weakness rush,"
364, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,Soft as the last drops round Heaven's airy bow.
365, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"For, though thy long dark lashes low depending,"
366, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,The soul of melancholy Gentleness
367, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"Gleams like a Seraph from the sky descending,"
368, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"Above all pain, yet pitying all distress;"
369, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"At once such majesty with sweetness blending,"
370, Lord Byron    Lord Byr,"I worship more, but cannot love thee less."
371, John Donne    John Don,I am a little world made cunningly
372, John Donne    John Don,"Of elements, and an angelic sprite;"
373, John Donne    John Don,But black sin hath betrayed to endless night
374, John Donne    John Don,"My worlds both parts, and (oh!) both parts must die."
375, John Donne    John Don,You which beyond that heaven which was most high
376, John Donne    John Don,"Have found new spheres, and of new lands can write,"
377, John Donne    John Don,"Pour new seas in mine eyes, that so I might"
378, John Donne    John Don,"Drown my world with my weeping earnestly,"
379, John Donne    John Don,Or wash it if it must be drowned no more:
380, John Donne    John Don,But oh it must be burnt! alas the fire
381, John Donne    John Don,"Of lust and envy have burnt it heretofore,"
382, John Donne    John Don,"And made it fouler: Let their flames retire,"
383, John Donne    John Don,"And burn me, O Lord, with a fiery zeal"
384, John Donne    John Don,"Of Thee and Thy house, which doth in eating heal."
385, John Donne    John Don,"This is my play's last scene, here heavens appoint"
386, John Donne    John Don,My pilgrimage's last mile; and my race
387, John Donne    John Don,"Idly, yet quickly run, hath this last pace,"
388, John Donne    John Don,"My span's last inch, my minute's latest point,"
389, John Donne    John Don,"And gluttonous death, will instantly unjoint"

397, John Donne    John Don,"Impute me righteous, thus purged of evil,"
398, John Donne    John Don,"For thus I leave the world, the flesh, the devil."
399, John Donne    John Don,"Show me, dear Christ, thy Spouse, so bright and clear."
400, John Donne    John Don,"What! is it She, which on the other shore"
401, John Donne    John Don,"Goes richly painted? or which, robbed and tore,"
402, John Donne    John Don,Laments and mourns in Germany and here?
403, John Donne    John Don,"Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one year?"
404, John Donne    John Don,"Is she self-truth and errs? now new, now outwore?"
405, John Donne    John Don,"Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore"
406, John Donne    John Don,"On one, on seven, or on no hill appear?"
407, John Donne    John Don,"Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights"
408, John Donne    John Don,First travail we to seek and then make love?
409, John Donne    John Don,"Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our sights,"
410, John Donne    John Don,"And let mine amorous soul court thy mild dove,"
411, John Donne    John Don,Who is most true and pleasing to thee then
412, John Donne    John Don,When she's embraced and open to most men.
413, John Donne    John Don,"Spit in my face you Jews, and pierce my side,"
414, John Donne    John Don,"Buffet, and scoff, scourge, and crucify me,"
415, John Donne    John Don,"For I have sinned, and sinned, and only he"
416, John Donne    John Don,Who could do no iniquity hath died:
417, John Donne    John Don,But by my death can not be satisfied
418, John Donne    John Don,"My sins, which pass the Jews' impiety:"
419, John Donne    John Don,"They killed once an inglorious man, but I"
420, John Donne    John Don,"Crucify him daily, being now glorified."
421, John Donne    John Don,"Oh let me, then, his strange love still admire:"
422, John Donne    John Don,"Kings pardon, but he bore our punishment."
423, John Donne    John Don,And Jacob came clothed in vile harsh attire
424, John Donne    John Don,"But to supplant, and with gainful intent:"
425, John Donne    John Don,"God clothed himself in vile man's flesh, that so"
426, John Donne    John Don,He might be weak enough to suffer woe.
427, John Donne    John Don,What if this present were the world's last night?
428, John Donne    John Don,"Mark in my heart, O soul, where thou dost dwell,"
429, John Donne    John Don,"The picture of Christ crucified, and tell"
430, John Donne    John Don,"Whether that countenance can thee affright,"
431, John Donne    John Don,"Tears in his eyes quench the amazing light,"
432, John Donne    John Don,"Blood fills his frowns, which from his pierced head fell."
433, John Donne    John Don,"And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell,"
434, John Donne    John Don,Which prayed forgiveness for his foes' fierce spite?
435, John Donne    John Don,"No, no; but as in my idolatry"
436, John Donne    John Don,"I said to all my profane mistresses,"
437, John Donne    John Don,"Beauty, of pity, foulness only is"
438, John Donne    John Don,"A sign of rigour: so I say to thee,"
439, John Donne    John Don,"To wicked spirits are horrid shapes assigned,"
440, John Donne    John Don,This beauteous form assures a piteous mind.
441, John Donne    John Don,"If poisonous minerals, and if that tree"
442, John Donne    John Don,"Whose fruit threw death on else immortal us,"
443, John Donne    John Don,"If lecherous goats, if serpents envious"
444, John Donne    John Don,"Cannot be damned, alas, why should I be?"
445, John Donne    John Don,"Why should intent or reason, born in me,"
446, John Donne    John Don,"Make sins, else equal, in me more heinous?"
447, John Donne    John Don,"And Mercy being easy, and glorious"
448, John Donne    John Don,"To God; in his stern wrath, why threatens he?"
449, John Donne    John Don,"But who am I, that dare dispute with thee"
450, John Donne    John Don,"O God? Oh! of thine only worthy blood,"
451, John Donne    John Don,"And my tears, make a heavenly Lethean flood,"
452, John Donne    John Don,And drown in it my sin's black memory;
453, John Donne    John Don,"That thou remember them, some claim as debt,"
454, John Donne    John Don,"I think it mercy, if thou wilt forget."
455, John Donne    John Don,"Tho has made me, and shall thy work decay?"
456, John Donne    John Don,"Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste;"
457, John Donne    John Don,"I run to death, and death meets me as fast,"
458, John Donne    John Don,And all my pleasures are like yesterday.
459, John Donne    John Don,"I dare not move my dim eyes any way,"
460, John Donne    John Don,"Despair behind, and death before doth cast"
461, John Donne    John Don,"Such terror, and my feeble flesh doth waste"
462, John Donne    John Don,"By sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh."
463, John Donne    John Don,"Only thou art above, and when towards thee"
464, John Donne    John Don,"By thy leave I can look, I rise again;"
465, John Donne    John Don,But our old subtle foe so tempteth me
466, John Donne    John Don,That not one hour myself I can sustain.
467, John Donne    John Don,"Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,"
468, John Donne    John Don,And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart.
469, John Donne    John Don,Oh my black soul! now art thou summoned
470, John Donne    John Don,"By sickness, death's herald, and champion;"
471, John Donne    John Don,"Thou art like a pilgrim, which abroad hath done"
472, John Donne    John Don,"Treason, and durst not turn to whence he is fled;"
473, John Donne    John Don,"Or like a thief, which till death's doom be read,"
474, John Donne    John Don,"Wisheth himself delivered from prison,"
475, John Donne    John Don,"But damned and haled to execution,"
476, John Donne    John Don,Wisheth that still he might be imprisoned.
477, John Donne    John Don,"Yet grace, if thou repent, thou canst not lack;"
478, John Donne    John Don,But who shall give thee that grace to begin?
479, John Donne    John Don,"Oh make thy self with holy mourning black,"
480, John Donne    John Don,"And red with blushing, as thou art with sin;"
481, John Donne    John Don,"Or wash thee in Christ's blood, which hath this might"
482, John Donne    John Don,"That being red, it dyes red souls to white"
483, John Donne    John Don,O might those sighs and tears return again
484, John Donne    John Don,"Into my breast and eyes, which I have spent,"
485, John Donne    John Don,That I might in this holy discontent
486, John Donne    John Don,"Mourn with some fruit, as I have mourned in vain;"
487, John Donne    John Don,In mine Idolatry what showers of rain
488, John Donne    John Don,Mine eyes did waste! what griefs my heart did rent!
489, John Donne    John Don,That sufferance was my sin; now I repent;
490, John Donne    John Don,'Cause I did suffer I must suffer pain.
491, John Donne    John Don,"Th' hydropic drunkard, and night-scouting thief,"
492, John Donne    John Don,"The itchy lecher, and self-tickling proud"
493, John Donne    John Don,Have the remembrance of past joys for relief
494, John Donne    John Don,Of comming ills. To (poor) me is allowed
495, John Donne    John Don,"No ease; for long, yet vehement grief hath been"
496, John Donne    John Don,"Th' effect and cause, the punishment and sin."
497, John Donne    John Don,As due by many titles I resign
498, John Donne    John Don,"My self to Thee, O God; first I was made"
499, John Donne    John Don,"By Thee, and for Thee, and when I was decayed"
500, John Donne    John Don,"Thy blood bought that, the which before was Thine;"
501, John Donne    John Don,"I am Thy son, made with Thy Self to shine,"
502, John Donne    John Don,"Thy servant, whose pains Thou hast still repaid,"
503, John Donne    John Don,"Thy sheep, thine image, and, till I betrayed"
504, John Donne    John Don,"My self, a temple of Thy Spirit divine;"
505, John Donne    John Don,Why doth the devil then usurp on me?
506, John Donne    John Don,"Why doth he steal, nay ravish that's thy right?"
507, John Donne    John Don,"Except thou rise and for thine own work fight,"
508, John Donne    John Don,"Oh I shall soon despair, when I do see"
509, John Donne    John Don,"That thou lov'st mankind well, yet wilt not choose me,"
510, John Donne    John Don,"And Satan hates me, yet is loth to lose me."
511, John Donne    John Don,"Wilt thou love God, as he thee? Then digest,"
512, John Donne    John Don,"My soul, this wholesome meditation,"
513, John Donne    John Don,"How God the Spirit, by angels waited on"
514, John Donne    John Don,"In heaven, doth make his Temple in thy breast."
515, John Donne    John Don,"The Father having begot a Son most blest,"
516, John Donne    John Don,"And still begetting, (for he ne'er be gone)"
517, John Donne    John Don,"Hath deigned to choose thee by adoption,"
518, John Donne    John Don,"Co-heir t' his glory, and Sabbath' endless rest."
519, John Donne    John Don,"And as a robbed man, which by search doth find"
520, John Donne    John Don,"His stol'n stuff sold, must lose or buy 't again:"
521, John Donne    John Don,"The Son of glory came down, and was slain,"
522, John Donne    John Don,"Us whom he'd made, and Satan stol'n, to unbind."
523, John Donne    John Don,"'Twas much that man was made like God before,"
524, John Donne    John Don,"But, that God should be made like man, much more."
525, John Donne    John Don,Why are we by all creatures waited on?
526, John Donne    John Don,Why do the prodigal elements supply
527, John Donne    John Don,"Life and food to me, being more pure than I,"
528, John Donne    John Don,"Simple, and further from corruption?"
529, John Donne    John Don,"Why brook'st thou, ignorant horse, subjection?"
530, John Donne    John Don,"Why dost thou, bull, and bore so seelily,"
531, John Donne    John Don,"Dissemble weakness, and by one man's stroke die,"
532, John Donne    John Don,Whose whole kind you might swallow and feed upon?
533, John Donne    John Don,"Weaker I am, woe is me, and worse than you,"
534, John Donne    John Don,"You have not sinned, nor need be timorous."
535, John Donne    John Don,"But wonder at a greater wonder, for to us"
536, John Donne    John Don,"Created nature doth these things subdue,"
537, John Donne    John Don,"But their Creator, whom sin nor nature tied,"
538, John Donne    John Don,"For us, His creatures, and His foes, hath died."
539, John Donne    John Don,If faithful souls be alike glorified
540, John Donne    John Don,"As angels, then my fathers soul doth see,"
541, John Donne    John Don,"And adds this even to full felicity,"
542, John Donne    John Don,That valiantly I hells wide mouth o'erstride:
543, John Donne    John Don,But if our minds to these souls be descried
544, John Donne    John Don,"By circumstances, and by signs that be"
545, John Donne    John Don,"Apparent in us, not immediately,"
546, John Donne    John Don,How shall my mind's white truth by them be tried?
547, John Donne    John Don,"They see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn,"
548, John Donne    John Don,And vile blasphemous conjurers to call
549, John Donne    John Don,"On Jesus name, and Pharisaical"
550, John Donne    John Don,"Dissemblers feigne devotion. Then turn,"
551, John Donne    John Don,"O pensive soul, to God, for he knows best"
552, John Donne    John Don,"Thy true grief, for he put it in my breast."
553, John Donne    John Don,"Father, part of his double interest"
554, John Donne    John Don,"Unto thy kingdom, thy Son gives to me,"
555, John Donne    John Don,His jointure in the knotty Trinity
556, John Donne    John Don,"He keeps, and gives to me his death's conquest."
557, John Donne    John Don,"This Lamb, whose death with life the world hath blest,"
558, John Donne    John Don,"Was from the world's beginning slain, and he"
559, John Donne    John Don,Hath made two Wills which with the Legacy
560, John Donne    John Don,Of his and thy kingdom do thy Sons invest.
561, John Donne    John Don,Yet such are thy laws that men argue yet
562, John Donne    John Don,Whether a man those statutes can fulfil;
563, John Donne    John Don,None doth; but all-healing grace and spirit
564, John Donne    John Don,Revive again what law and letter kill.
565, John Donne    John Don,"Thy law's abridgement, and thy last command"
566, John Donne    John Don,Is all but love; Oh let this last Will stand!
567, Michael Drayton    Mic,"An evil spirit, your beauty haunts me still, "
568, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Wherewith, alas, I have been long possest, "
569, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Which ceaseth not to tempt me to each ill, "
570, Michael Drayton    Mic,Nor gives me once but one poor minute's rest; 
571, Michael Drayton    Mic,"In me it speaks, whether I sleep or wake, "
572, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And when by means to drive it out I try, "
573, Michael Drayton    Mic,"With greater torments then it me doth take, "
574, Michael Drayton    Mic,And tortures me in most extremity; 
575, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Before my face it lays down my despairs, "
576, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And hastes me on unto a sudden death, "
577, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Now tempting me to drown myself in tears, "
578, Michael Drayton    Mic,And then in sighing to give up my breath. 
579, Michael Drayton    Mic,Thus am I still provok'd to every evil 
580, Michael Drayton    Mic,"By this good wicked spirit, sweet angel-devil."
581, Michael Drayton    Mic,What? Dost thou mean to cheat me of my heart? 
582, Michael Drayton    Mic,To take all mine and give me none again? 
583, Michael Drayton    Mic,Or have thine eyes such magic or that art 
584, Michael Drayton    Mic,That what they get they ever do retain? 
585, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Play not the tyrant, but take some remorse; "
586, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Rebate thy spleen, if but for pity's sake; "
587, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Or, cruel, if thou canst not, let us 'scourse,"
588, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And, for one piece of thine, my whole heart take. "
589, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But what of pity do I speak to thee, "
590, Michael Drayton    Mic,Whose breast is proof against complaint or prayer? 
591, Michael Drayton    Mic,Or can I think what my reward shall be 
592, Michael Drayton    Mic,"From that proud beauty, which was my betrayer? "
593, Michael Drayton    Mic,"What talk I of a heart, when thou hast none? "
594, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Or, if thou hast, it is a flinty one."
595, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Like an advent'rous seafarer am I, "
596, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Who hath some long and dang'rous voyage been, "
597, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And, call'd to tell of his discovery, "
598, Michael Drayton    Mic,"How far he sail'd, what countries he had seen; "
599, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Proceeding from the port whence he put forth, "
600, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Shows by his compass how his course he steer'd, "
601, Michael Drayton    Mic,"When East, when West, when South, and when by North, "
602, Michael Drayton    Mic,"As how the Pole to every place was rear'd, "
603, Michael Drayton    Mic,"What capes he doubled, of what Continent, "
604, Michael Drayton    Mic,"The gulfs and straits that strangely he had past, "
605, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Where most becalm'd, where with foul weather spent, "
606, Michael Drayton    Mic,And on what rocks in peril to be cast: 
607, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Thus in my love, Time calls me to relate "
608, Michael Drayton    Mic,My tedious travels and oft-varying fate.
609, Michael Drayton    Mic,O why should Nature niggardly restrain 
610, Michael Drayton    Mic,That foreign nations relish not our tongue? 
611, Michael Drayton    Mic,Else should my lines glide on the waves of Rhene 
612, Michael Drayton    Mic,And crown the Pyrens with my living song. 
613, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But, bounded thus, to Scotland get you forth, "
614, Michael Drayton    Mic,Thence take you wing unto the Orcades; 
615, Michael Drayton    Mic,"There let my verse get glory in the North, "
616, Michael Drayton    Mic,Making my sighs to thaw the frozen seas; 
617, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And let the Bards within that Irish isle, "
618, Michael Drayton    Mic,"To whom my Muse with fiery wing shall pass, "
619, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Call back the stiff-neck'd rebels from exile, "
620, Michael Drayton    Mic,And mollify the slaught'ring Gallowglass; 
621, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And when my flowing numbers they rehearse, "
622, Michael Drayton    Mic,Let wolves and bears be charmed with my verse.
623, Michael Drayton    Mic,"When first I ended, then I first began, "
624, Michael Drayton    Mic,"The more I travell'd, further from my rest, "
625, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Where most I lost, there most of all I wan,"
626, Michael Drayton    Mic,Pined with hunger rising from a feast. 
627, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Methinks I fly, yet want I legs to go, "
628, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Wise in conceit, in act a very sot, "
629, Michael Drayton    Mic,Ravish'd with joy amid a hell of woe; 
630, Michael Drayton    Mic,"What most I seem, that surest am I not. "
631, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I build my hopes a world above the sky, "
632, Michael Drayton    Mic,Yet with the mole I creep into the earth; 
633, Michael Drayton    Mic,"In plenty I am starv'd with penury, "
634, Michael Drayton    Mic,And yet I surfeit in the greatest dearth. 
635, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I have, I want, despair and yet desire, "
636, Michael Drayton    Mic,Burn'd in a sea of ice and drown'd amidst a fire.
637, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Some, when in rhyme they of their loves do tell, "
638, Michael Drayton    Mic,With flames and lightnings their exordiums paint; 
639, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Some call on Heav'n, some invocate on Hell, "
640, Michael Drayton    Mic,And Fates and Furies with their woes acquaint. 
641, Michael Drayton    Mic,Elysium is too high a seat for me; 
642, Michael Drayton    Mic,I will not come in Styx or Phlegethon; 
643, Michael Drayton    Mic,The thrice-three Muses but too wanton be; 
644, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Like they that lust, I care not; I will none. "
645, Michael Drayton    Mic,Spiteful Erinnys frights me with her looks; 
646, Michael Drayton    Mic,My manhood dares not with foul Ate mell; 
647, Michael Drayton    Mic,I quake to look on Hecate's charming books; 
648, Michael Drayton    Mic,I still fear bugbears in Apollo's cell. 
649, Michael Drayton    Mic,I pass not for Minerva nor Astraea; 
650, Michael Drayton    Mic,Only I call on my divine Idea.
651, Michael Drayton    Mic,"As Love and I, late harbor'd in one inn, "

655, Michael Drayton    Mic,"""Who spares to speak doth spare to speed,"" quoth I; "
656, Michael Drayton    Mic,"""As well,"" saith he, ""too forward as too slow""; "
657, Michael Drayton    Mic,"""Fortune assists the boldest,"" I reply; "
658, Michael Drayton    Mic,"""A hasty man,"" quoth he, ""ne'er wanted woe""; "
659, Michael Drayton    Mic,"""Labor is light where Love,"" quoth I, ""doth pay""; "
660, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Saith he, ""Light burden's heavy, if far borne""; "
661, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Quoth I, ""The main lost, cast the bye away""; "
662, Michael Drayton    Mic,"""You have spun a fair thread,"" he replies in scorn. "
663, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And having thus awhile each other thwarted, "
664, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Fools as we met, so fools again we parted. "
665, Michael Drayton    Mic,To Admiration
666, Michael Drayton    Mic,
667, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Marvel not, Love, though I thy power admire, "
668, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Ravish'd a world beyond the farthest thought, "
669, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And knowing more than ever hath been taught, "
670, Michael Drayton    Mic,That I am only starv'd in my desire. 
671, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Marvel not, Love, though I thy power admire, "
672, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Aiming at things exceeding all perfection, "
673, Michael Drayton    Mic,"To Wisdom's self to minister correction, "
674, Michael Drayton    Mic,That I am only starv'd in my desire. 
675, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Marvel not, Love, though I thy power admire, "
676, Michael Drayton    Mic,Though my conceit I further seem to bend 
677, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Than possibly invention can extend, "
678, Michael Drayton    Mic,And yet am only starv'd in my desire. 
679, Michael Drayton    Mic,"If thou wilt wonder, here's the wonder, Love: "
680, Michael Drayton    Mic,That this to me doth yet no wonder prove.
681, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Love, banish'd Heav'n, on Earth was held in scorn, "
682, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Wand'ring abroad in need and beggary, "
683, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And wanting friends, though of a Goddess born, "
684, Michael Drayton    Mic,Yet crav'd the alms of such as passed by. 
685, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I, like a man devout and charitable, "
686, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Clothed the naked, lodg'd this wand'ring guest, "
687, Michael Drayton    Mic,With sighs and tears still furnishing his table 
688, Michael Drayton    Mic,With what might make the miserable blest. 
689, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But this ungrateful, for my good desert, "
690, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Entic'd my thoughts against me to conspire, "
691, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Who gave consent to steal away my heart, "
692, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And set my breast, his lodging, on a fire. "
693, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Well, well, my friends, when beggars grow thus bold, "
694, Michael Drayton    Mic,No marvel then though charity grow cold. 
695, Michael Drayton    Mic,His Remedy for Love
696, Michael Drayton    Mic,
697, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Since to obtain thee nothing will be stead, "
698, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I have a med'cine that shall cure my love, "
699, Michael Drayton    Mic,"The powder of her heart dried, when she is dead, "
700, Michael Drayton    Mic,"That gold nor honor ne'er had power to move, "
701, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Mixt with her tears, that ne'er her true-love crost "
702, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Nor at fifteen ne'er long'd to be a bride, "
703, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Boil'd with her sighs in giving up the ghost, "
704, Michael Drayton    Mic,That for her late deceased husband died; 
705, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Into the same then let a woman breathe, "
706, Michael Drayton    Mic,"That, being chid, did never word reply, "
707, Michael Drayton    Mic,"With one thrice-married's prayers, that did bequeath "
708, Michael Drayton    Mic,A legacy to stale virginity. 
709, Michael Drayton    Mic,"If this receipt have not the power to win me, "
710, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Little I'll say, but think the Devil's in me. "
711, Michael Drayton    Mic,"There's nothing grieves me, but that Age should haste, "
712, Michael Drayton    Mic,"That in my days I may not see thee old, "
713, Michael Drayton    Mic,That where those two clear sparkling eyes are plac'd 
714, Michael Drayton    Mic,Only two loop-holes then I might behold; 
715, Michael Drayton    Mic,"That lovely, arched, ivory, polish'd brow "
716, Michael Drayton    Mic,Defac'd with wrinkles that I might but see; 
717, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Thy dainty hair, so curl'd and crisped now, "
718, Michael Drayton    Mic,Like grizzled moss upon some aged tree; 
719, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Thy cheek, now flush with roses, sunk and lean; "
720, Michael Drayton    Mic,Thy lips with age as any wafer thin; 
721, Michael Drayton    Mic,Thy pearly teeth out of thy head so clean 
722, Michael Drayton    Mic,"That, when thou feed'st, thy nose shall touch thy chin. "
723, Michael Drayton    Mic,"These lines that now thou scorn'st, which should delight thee, "
724, Michael Drayton    Mic,Then would I make thee read but to despite thee. 
725, Michael Drayton    Mic,To nothing fitter can I thee compare 
726, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Than to the son of some rich penny-father, "
727, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Who, having now brought on his end with care, "
728, Michael Drayton    Mic,Leaves to his son all he had heap'd together; 
729, Michael Drayton    Mic,"This new rich novice, lavish of his chest, "
730, Michael Drayton    Mic,"To one man gives, doth on another spend, "
731, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Then here he riots, yet among the rest "
732, Michael Drayton    Mic,Haps to lend some to one true honest friend. 
733, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Thy gifts thou in obscurity dost waste, "
734, Michael Drayton    Mic,"False friends thy kindness, born but to deceive thee, "
735, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Thy love that is on the unworthy plac'd, "
736, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Time hath thy beauty, which with age will leave thee; "
737, Michael Drayton    Mic,Only that little which to me was lent 
738, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I give thee back, when all the rest is spent. "
739, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Yet read at last the story of my woe, "
740, Michael Drayton    Mic,"The dreary abstracts of my endless cares, "
741, Michael Drayton    Mic,"With my life's sorrow interlined so, "
742, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Smok'd with my sighs and blotted with my tears, "
743, Michael Drayton    Mic,"The sad memorials of my miseries, "
744, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Penn'd in the grief of mine afflicted ghost, "
745, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My life's complaint in doleful elegies, "
746, Michael Drayton    Mic,With so pure love as Time could never boast. 
747, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Receive the incense which I offer here, "
748, Michael Drayton    Mic,"By my strong faith ascending to thy fame, "
749, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My zeal, my hope, my vows, my praise, my prayer, "
750, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My soul's oblation to thy sacred name, "
751, Michael Drayton    Mic,Which name my Muse to highest heav'ns shall raise 
752, Michael Drayton    Mic,"By chaste desire, true love, and virtuous praise. "
753, Michael Drayton    Mic,To Humor
754, Michael Drayton    Mic,
755, Michael Drayton    Mic,"You cannot love, my pretty heart, and why? "
756, Michael Drayton    Mic,There was a time you told me that you would; 
757, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But now again you will the same deny, "
758, Michael Drayton    Mic,"If it might please you, would to God you could. "
759, Michael Drayton    Mic,"What, will you hate? Nay, that you will not, neither. "
760, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Nor love nor hate, how then? What will you do? "
761, Michael Drayton    Mic,"What, will you keep a mean then betwixt either, "
762, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Or will you love me and yet hate me, too? "
763, Michael Drayton    Mic,Yet serves this not. What next? What other shift? 
764, Michael Drayton    Mic,"You will, and will not; what a coil is here. "
765, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I see your craft, now I perceive your drift, "
766, Michael Drayton    Mic,And all this while I was mistaken there; 
767, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Your love and hate is this, I now do prove you: "
768, Michael Drayton    Mic,"You love in hate, by hate to make me love you."
769, Michael Drayton    Mic,"To such as say thy love I overprize, "
770, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And do not stick to term my praises folly, "
771, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Against these folks, that think themselves so wise, "
772, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I thus oppose my Reason's forces wholly, "
773, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Though I give more than well affords my state, "
774, Michael Drayton    Mic,"In which expense the most suppose me vain, "
775, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Which yields them nothing at the easiest rate, "
776, Michael Drayton    Mic,Yet at this price returns me treble gain. 
777, Michael Drayton    Mic,"They value not, unskillful how to use, "
778, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And I give much, because I gain thereby; "
779, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I that thus take, or they that thus refuse, "
780, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Whether are these deceived then, or I? "
781, Michael Drayton    Mic,In everything I hold this maxim still: 
782, Michael Drayton    Mic,The circumstance doth make it good or ill. 
783, Michael Drayton    Mic,To the Critic
784, Michael Drayton    Mic,
785, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Methinks I see some crooked mimic jeer, "
786, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And tax my Muse with this fantastic grace, "
787, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Turning my papers asks, ""What have we here?"" "
788, Michael Drayton    Mic,Making withal some filthy antic face. 
789, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I fear no censure, nor what thou canst say, "
790, Michael Drayton    Mic,Nor shall my spirit one jot of vigor lose; 
791, Michael Drayton    Mic,Think'st thou my wit shall keep the pack-horse way 
792, Michael Drayton    Mic,That every dudgen low invention goes? 
793, Michael Drayton    Mic,Since sonnets thus in bundles are imprest 
794, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And every drudge doth dull our satiate ear, "
795, Michael Drayton    Mic,Think'st thou my love shall in those rags be drest 
796, Michael Drayton    Mic,"That every dowdy, every trull, doth wear? "
797, Michael Drayton    Mic,Up to my pitch no common judgement flies; 
798, Michael Drayton    Mic,I scorn all earthly dung-bred scarabies. 
799, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Since there's no help, come, let us kiss and part, "
800, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Nay, I have done, you get no more of me, "
801, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And I am glad, yea, glad with all my heart, "
802, Michael Drayton    Mic,That thus so cleanly I myself can free. 
803, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows, "
804, Michael Drayton    Mic,And when we meet at any time again 
805, Michael Drayton    Mic,Be it not seen in either of our brows 
806, Michael Drayton    Mic,That we one jot of former love retain. 
807, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Now at the last gasp of Love's latest breath, "
808, Michael Drayton    Mic,"When, his pulse failing, Passion speechless lies, "
809, Michael Drayton    Mic,"When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death, "
810, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And Innocence is closing up his eyes, "
811, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Now, if thou wouldst, when all have giv'n him over, "
812, Michael Drayton    Mic,From death to life thou might'st him yet recover.
813, Michael Drayton    Mic,"You not alone, when you are still alone, "
814, Michael Drayton    Mic,"O God, from you that I could private be. "
815, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Since you one were, I never since was one; "
816, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Since you in me, my self since out of me, "
817, Michael Drayton    Mic,Transported from my self into your being; 
818, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Though either distant, present yet to either, "
819, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Senseless with too much joy, each other seeing, "
820, Michael Drayton    Mic,And only absent when we are together. 
821, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Give me my self and take your self again, "
822, Michael Drayton    Mic,Devise some means but how I may forsake you; 
823, Michael Drayton    Mic,"So much is mine that doth with you remain, "
824, Michael Drayton    Mic,"That, taking what is mine, with me I take you; "
825, Michael Drayton    Mic,"You do bewitch me; O, that I could fly "
826, Michael Drayton    Mic,"From my self you, or from your own self I."
827, Michael Drayton    Mic,An Allusion to the Phoenix
828, Michael Drayton    Mic,
829, Michael Drayton    Mic,'Mongst all the creatures in this spacious round 
830, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Of the birds' kind, the Phoenix is alone, "
831, Michael Drayton    Mic,Which best by you of living things is known; 
832, Michael Drayton    Mic,"None like to that, none like to you is found. "
833, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Your beauty is the hot and splend'rous sun, "
834, Michael Drayton    Mic,"The precious spices be your chaste desire, "
835, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Which being kindled by that heav'nly fire, "
836, Michael Drayton    Mic,Your life so like the Phoenix's begun; 
837, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Yourself thus burned in that sacred flame, "
838, Michael Drayton    Mic,"With so rare sweetness all the heav'ns perfuming, "
839, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Again increasing as you are consuming, "
840, Michael Drayton    Mic,Only by dying born the very same; 
841, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And, wing'd by fame, you to the stars ascend, "
842, Michael Drayton    Mic,So you of time shall live beyond the end.
843, Michael Drayton    Mic,A witless gallant a young wench that woo'd 
844, Michael Drayton    Mic,"(Yet his dull spirit her not one jot could move), "
845, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Entreated me, as e'er I wish'd his good, "
846, Michael Drayton    Mic,To write him but one sonnet to his love; 
847, Michael Drayton    Mic,"When I, as fast as e'er my pen could trot, "
848, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Pour'd out what first from quick invention came, "
849, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Nor never stood one word thereof to blot, "
850, Michael Drayton    Mic,Much like his wit that was to use the same; 
851, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But with my verses he his mistress won, "
852, Michael Drayton    Mic,Which doted on the dolt beyond all measure. 
853, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But see, for you to Heav'n for phrase I run, "
854, Michael Drayton    Mic,And ransack all Apollo's golden treasure; 
855, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Yet by my froth this fool his love obtains, "
856, Michael Drayton    Mic,And I lose you for all my love and pains.
857, Michael Drayton    Mic,"As other men, so I myself do muse "
858, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Why in this sort I wrest invention so, "
859, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And why these giddy metaphors I use, "
860, Michael Drayton    Mic,Leaving the path the greater part do go. 
861, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I will resolve you: I am lunatic, "
862, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And ever this in madmen you shall find, "
863, Michael Drayton    Mic,What they last thought of when the brain grew sick 
864, Michael Drayton    Mic,In most distraction they keep that in mind. 
865, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Thus talking idly in this bedlam fit, "
866, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Reason and I, you must conceive, are twain; "
867, Michael Drayton    Mic,"""Tis nine years now since first I lost my wit; "
868, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Bear with me then, though troubled be my brain. "
869, Michael Drayton    Mic,With diet and correction men distraught 
870, Michael Drayton    Mic,(Not too far past) may to their wits be brought.
871, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Into these Loves who but for Passion looks, "
872, Michael Drayton    Mic,At this first sight here let him lay them by 
873, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And seek elsewhere, in turning other books, "
874, Michael Drayton    Mic,Which better may his labor satisfy. 
875, Michael Drayton    Mic,"No far-fetch'd sigh shall ever wound my breast, "
876, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Love from mine eye a tear shall never wring, "
877, Michael Drayton    Mic,Nor in Ah me's my whining sonnets drest; 
878, Michael Drayton    Mic,"A libertine, fantasticly I sing. "
879, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My verse is the true image of my mind, "
880, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Ever in motion, still desiring change, "
881, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And as thus to variety inclin'd, "
882, Michael Drayton    Mic,So in all humours sportively I range. 
883, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My Muse is rightly of the English strain, "
884, Michael Drayton    Mic,That cannot long one fashion entertain.
885, Michael Drayton    Mic,To Despair
886, Michael Drayton    Mic,
887, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I ever love where never hope appears, "
888, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Yet hope draws on my never-hoping care, "
889, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And my life's hope would die, but for despair; "
890, Michael Drayton    Mic,My never-certain joy breeds ever-certain fears; 
891, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Uncertain dread gives wings unto my hope, "
892, Michael Drayton    Mic,Yet my hope's wings are laden so with fear 
893, Michael Drayton    Mic,As they cannot ascend to my hope's sphere; 
894, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Though fear gives them more than a heav'nly scope, "
895, Michael Drayton    Mic,Yet this large room is bounded with despair; 
896, Michael Drayton    Mic,"So my love is still fetter'd with vain hope, "
897, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And liberty deprives him of his scope, "
898, Michael Drayton    Mic,And thus am I imprison'd in the air. 
899, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Then, sweet despair, awhile hold up thy head, "
900, Michael Drayton    Mic,Or all my hope for sorrow will be dead.
901, Michael Drayton    Mic,To Folly
902, Michael Drayton    Mic,
903, Michael Drayton    Mic,"With fools and children, good discretion bears; "
904, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Then, honest people, bear with Love and me, "
905, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Nor older yet, nor wiser made by years, "
906, Michael Drayton    Mic,Amongst the rest of fools and children be; 
907, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Love, still a baby, plays with gauds and toys, "
908, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And, like a wanton, sports with every feather, "
909, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And idiots still are running after boys, "
910, Michael Drayton    Mic,Then fools and children fitt'st to go together. 
911, Michael Drayton    Mic,"He still as young as when he first was born, "
912, Michael Drayton    Mic,No wiser I than when as young as he; 
913, Michael Drayton    Mic,"You that behold us, laugh us not to scorn; "
914, Michael Drayton    Mic,Give Nature thanks you are not such as we. 
915, Michael Drayton    Mic,Yet fools and children sometimes tell in play 
916, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Some, wise in show, more fools indeed than they. "
917, Michael Drayton    Mic,To Miracle
918, Michael Drayton    Mic,
919, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Some, misbelieving and profane in love, "
920, Michael Drayton    Mic,"When I do speak of miracles by thee, "
921, Michael Drayton    Mic,"May say, that thou art flattered by me, "
922, Michael Drayton    Mic,Who only write my skill in verse to prove. 
923, Michael Drayton    Mic,"See miracles, ye unbelieving, see "
924, Michael Drayton    Mic,"A dumb-born Muse made t'express the mind, "
925, Michael Drayton    Mic,"A cripple hand to write, yet lame by kind, "
926, Michael Drayton    Mic,"One by thy name, the other touching thee; "
927, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Blind were mine eyes, till they were seen of thine, "
928, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And mine ears deaf by thy fame healed be, "
929, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My vices cur'd by virtues sprung from thee, "
930, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My hopes reviv'd, which long in grave had lien,"
931, Michael Drayton    Mic,"All unclean thoughts, foul spirits, cast out in me "
932, Michael Drayton    Mic,Only by virtue that proceeds from thee. 
933, Michael Drayton    Mic,Another to the River Anker
934, Michael Drayton    Mic,
935, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Clear Anker, on whose silver-sanded shore "
936, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My soul-shrin'd saint, my fair Idea, lies, "
937, Michael Drayton    Mic,"O blessed brook, whose milk-white swans adore "
938, Michael Drayton    Mic,"The crystal stream refined by her eyes, "
939, Michael Drayton    Mic,Where sweet myrrh-breathing Zephyr in the Spring 
940, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Gently distils his nectar-dropping showers, "
941, Michael Drayton    Mic,Where nightingales in Arden sit and sing 
942, Michael Drayton    Mic,Among the dainty dew-impearled flowers; 
943, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Say thus, fair Brook, when thou shalt see thy Queen, "
944, Michael Drayton    Mic,"""Lo, here thy shepherd spent his wand'ring years, "
945, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And in these shades, dear nymph, he oft hath been, "
946, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And here to thee he sacrific'd his tears."" "
947, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Fair Arden, thou my Tempe art alone, "
948, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And thou, sweet Anker, art my Helicon. "
949, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Sitting alone, Love bids me go and write; "
950, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Reason plucks back, commanding me to stay, "
951, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Boasting that she doth still direct the way, "
952, Michael Drayton    Mic,Or else Love were unable to endite. 
953, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Love, growing angry, vexed at the spleen "
954, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And scorning Reason's maimed argument, "
955, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Straight taxeth Reason, wanting to invent, "
956, Michael Drayton    Mic,Where she with Love conversing hath not been. 
957, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Reason, reproached with this coy disdain, "
958, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Despiteth Love, and laugheth at her folly; "
959, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And Love, condemning Reason's reason wholly, "
960, Michael Drayton    Mic,Thought it in weight too light by many'a grain. 
961, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Reason, put back, doth out of sight remove, "
962, Michael Drayton    Mic,And Love alone picks reason out of love.
963, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Thou leaden brain, which censur'st what I write, "
964, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And say'st my lines be dull and do not move, "
965, Michael Drayton    Mic,"I marvel not thou feel'st not my delight, "
966, Michael Drayton    Mic,Which never felt'st my fiery touch of love. 
967, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But thou, whose pen hath like a pack-horse serv'd, "
968, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Whose stomach unto gall hath turn'd thy food, "
969, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Whose senses, like poor prisoners, hunger-starv'd, "
970, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Whose grief hath parch'd thy body, dried thy blood, "
971, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Thou which hast scorned life and hated death, "
972, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And in a moment mad, sober, glad, and sorry, "
973, Michael Drayton    Mic,Thou which hast bann'd thy thoughts and curs'd thy breath 
974, Michael Drayton    Mic,"With thousand plagues, more than in Purgatory, "
975, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Thou thus whose spirit Love in his fire refines, "
976, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Come thou, and read, admire, applaud my lines. "
977, Michael Drayton    Mic,Love's Lunacy
978, Michael Drayton    Mic,
979, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Why do I speak of joy, or write of love, "
980, Michael Drayton    Mic,"When my heart is the very den of horror, "
981, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And in my soul the pains of Hell I prove, "
982, Michael Drayton    Mic,With all his torments and infernal terror?

984, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My brain is dry with weeping all too long, "
985, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My sighs be spent in uttering my woe, "
986, Michael Drayton    Mic,And I want words wherewith to tell my wrong; 
987, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But, still distracted in Love's lunacy, "
988, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And, bedlam-like, thus raging in my grief, "

991, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Now I deny her, then I do confess her, "
992, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Now do I curse her, then again I bless her. "
993, Michael Drayton    Mic,My heart the anvil where my thoughts do beat; 
994, Michael Drayton    Mic,My words the hammers fashioning my desire; 
995, Michael Drayton    Mic,My breast the forge including all the heat; 
996, Michael Drayton    Mic,Love is the fuel which maintains the fire; 
997, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My sighs the bellows which the flame increaseth, "
998, Michael Drayton    Mic,Filling mine ears with noise and nightly groaning; 
999, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Toiling with pain, my labor never ceaseth, "
1000, Michael Drayton    Mic,In grievous passions my woes still bemoaning; 
1001, Michael Drayton    Mic,"My eyes with tears against the fire striving, "

1007, Michael Drayton    Mic,Why should your fair eyes with such sovereign grace

1009, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Whilst I in darkness, in the self-same place, "
1010, Michael Drayton    Mic,Get not one glance to recompense my merit? 
1011, Michael Drayton    Mic,"So doth the plowman gaze the wand'ring star, "

1029, Michael Drayton    Mic,"By Hecate's names, by Proserpine's sad tears "
1030, Michael Drayton    Mic,"When she was rapt to the infernal bower, "
1031, Michael Drayton    Mic,"By thine own loved Psyche, by the fires "
1032, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Spent on thine alters flaming up to heav'n, "
1033, Michael Drayton    Mic,"By all true lovers' sighs, vows, and desires, "
1034, Michael Drayton    Mic,By all the wounds that ever thou hast giv'n: 
1035, Michael Drayton    Mic,I conjure thee by all that I have nam'd 
1036, Michael Drayton    Mic,"To make her love, or, Cupid, be thou damn'd. "
1037, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Plain-path'd Experience, th'unlearned's guide, "
1038, Michael Drayton    Mic,Her simple followers evidently shows 
1039, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Sometimes what Schoolmen scarcely can decide, "
1040, Michael Drayton    Mic,Nor yet wise Reason absolutely knows. 
1041, Michael Drayton    Mic,"In making trial of a murther wrought, "
1042, Michael Drayton    Mic,If the vile actors of the heinous deed 
1043, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Near the dead body happily be brought, "
1044, Michael Drayton    Mic,Oft it hath been prov'd the breathless corse will bleed.
1045, Michael Drayton    Mic,"She's coming near, that my poor heart hath slain, "
1046, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Long since departed, to the world no more, "
1047, Michael Drayton    Mic,"The ancient wounds no longer can contain, "
1048, Michael Drayton    Mic,But fall to bleeding as they did before. 
1049, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But what of this? Should she to death be led, "
1050, Michael Drayton    Mic,"It furthers justice, but helps not the dead. "
1051, Michael Drayton    Mic,"When like an eaglet I first found my Love, "
1052, Michael Drayton    Mic,"For that the virtue I thereof would know, "
1053, Michael Drayton    Mic,Upon the nest I set it forth to prove 
1054, Michael Drayton    Mic,If it were of that kingly kind or no; 
1055, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But it no sooner say my Sun appear, "
1056, Michael Drayton    Mic,"But on her rays with open eyes it stood, "
1057, Michael Drayton    Mic,To show that I had hatch'd it for the air 
1058, Michael Drayton    Mic,And rightly came from that brave mounting brood; 
1059, Michael Drayton    Mic,"And, when the plumes were summ'd with sweet desire,"
1060, Michael Drayton    Mic,To prove the pinions it ascends the skies; 
1061, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Do what I could, it needsly would aspire"
1062, Michael Drayton    Mic,"To my Soul's Sun, those two celestial eyes. "
1063, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Thus from my breast, where it was bred alone, "
1064, Michael Drayton    Mic,"It after thee is, like an eaglet, flown. "
1065, Michael Drayton    Mic,"In former times such as had store of coin, "
1066, Michael Drayton    Mic,"In wars at home, or when for conquests bound, "
1067, Michael Drayton    Mic,"For fear that some their treasure should purloin, "
1068, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Gave it to keep to spirits within the ground, "
1069, Michael Drayton    Mic,And to attend it them as strongly tied 
1070, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Till they return'd; home when they never came, "
1071, Michael Drayton    Mic,Such as by art to get the same have tried 
1072, Michael Drayton    Mic,From the strong Spirit by no means force the same; 
1073, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Nearer men come, that further flies away, "
1074, Michael Drayton    Mic,Striving to hold it strongly in the deep. 
1075, Michael Drayton    Mic,"E'en as this Spirit, so you alone do play "
1076, Michael Drayton    Mic,With those rich beauties Heav'n gives you to keep; 
1077, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Pity, so left to the coldness of your blood, "
1078, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Not to avail you, nor do the others good. "
1079, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Muses, which sadly sit about my chair, "
1080, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Drown'd in the tears extorted by my lines, "
1081, Michael Drayton    Mic,"With heavy sighs whilst thus I break the air, "
1082, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Painting my passions in these sad designs, "
1083, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Since she disdains to bless my happy verse, "
1084, Michael Drayton    Mic,"The strong-built trophies to her living fame, "
1085, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Ever henceforth my bosom be your hearse, "
1086, Michael Drayton    Mic,Wherein the world shall now entomb her name. 
1087, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Enclose my music, you poor senseless walls, "
1088, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Since she is deaf and will not hear my moans, "
1089, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Soften yourselves with every tear that falls, "
1090, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Whilst I, like Orpheus, sing to trees and stones, "
1091, Michael Drayton    Mic,"Which with my plaint seem yet with pity mov'd, "
1092, Michael Drayton    Mic,Kinder than she whom I so long have lov'd.
