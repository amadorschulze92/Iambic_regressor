0,Frost,"One of my wishes is that those dark trees,"
1,Frost,"So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,"
2,Frost,"Were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,"
3,Frost,But stretched away unto the edge of doom.
4,Frost,I should not be withheld but that some day
5,Frost,"Into their vastness I should steal away,"
6,Frost,"Fearless of ever finding open land,"
7,Frost,Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand.
8,Frost,"I do not see why I should e'er turn back,"
9,Frost,Or those should not set forth upon my track
10,Frost,"To overtake me, who should miss me here"
11,Frost,And long to know if still I held them dear.
12,Frost,They would not find me changed from him they knew
13,Frost,Only more sure of all I thought was true.
14,Frost,"I had withdrawn in forest, and my song"
15,Frost,"Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway,"
16,Frost,And to the forest edge you came one day
17,Frost,"(This was my dream) and looked and pondered long,"
18,Frost,"But did not enter, though the wish was strong:"
19,Frost,"You shook your pensive head as who should say,"
20,Frost,'I dare nottoo far in his footsteps stray
21,Frost,He must seek me would he undo the wrong.'
22,Frost,"Not far, but near, I stood and saw it all"
23,Frost,Behind low boughs the trees let down outside;
24,Frost,And the sweet pang it cost me not to call
25,Frost,"And tell you that I saw does still abide,"
26,Frost,"But 'tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof,"
27,Frost,"For the wood wakes, and you are here for proof."
28,Frost,"If tired of trees I seek again mankind,"
29,Frost,"Well I know where to hie mein the dawn,"
30,Frost,To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn.
31,Frost,"There amid lolling juniper reclined,"
32,Frost,"Myself unseen, I see in white defined"
33,Frost,"Far off the homes of men, and farther still,"
34,Frost,"The graves of men on an opposing hill,"
35,Frost,"Living or dead, whichever are to mind."
36,Frost,"And if by noon I have too much of these,"
37,Frost,"I have but to turn on my arm, and lo,"
38,Frost,"The sunburned hillside sets my face aglow,"
39,Frost,"My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze,"
40,Frost,"I smell the earth, I smell the bruis√®d plant,"
41,Frost,I look into the crater of the ant.
42,Frost,"There was never a sound beside the wood but one,"
43,Frost,And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.
44,Frost,What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;
45,Frost,"Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,"
46,Frost,"Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound"
47,Frost,And that was why it whispered and did not speak.
48,Frost,"It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,"
49,Frost,Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:
50,Frost,Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
51,Frost,"To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,"
52,Frost,Not without feeblepointed spikes of flowers
53,Frost,"(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake."
54,Frost,The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.
55,Frost,My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.
56,Frost,"There is a singer everyone has heard,"
57,Frost,"Loud, a midsummer and a midwood bird,"
58,Frost,Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.
59,Frost,He says that leaves are old and that for flowers
60,Frost,Midsummer is to spring as one to ten.
61,Frost,He says the early petalfall is past
62,Frost,When pear and cherry bloom went down in the showers
63,Frost,On sunny days a moment overcast;
64,Frost,And comes that other fall we name the fall.
65,Frost,He says the highway dust is over all.
66,Frost,The bird would cease and be as other birds
67,Frost,But that he knows in singing not to sing.
68,Frost,The question that he frames in all but words
69,Frost,Is what to make of a diminished thing.
70,Frost,The battle rent a cobweb diamondstrung
71,Frost,And cut a flower beside a ground bird's nest
72,Frost,Before it strained a single human breast.
73,Frost,The stricken flower bent double and so hung.
74,Frost,And still the bird revisited her young.
75,Frost,A butterfly its fall had dispossessed
76,Frost,"A moment sought in air his flower of rest,"
77,Frost,Then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung.
78,Frost,On the bare upland pasture there had spread
79,Frost,O'ernight 'twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread
80,Frost,And straining cables wet with silver dew.
81,Frost,A sudden passing bullet shook it dry.
82,Frost,"The indwelling spider ran to greet the fly,"
83,Frost,"But finding nothing, sullenly withdrew."
